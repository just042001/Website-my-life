            <h2>Soccer</h2>
            <p>
              My hobby is playing soccer. I've been playing soccer since I was 3 years old and after that I have fallen in love with the sport. Without soccer my life would be nothing.<br>
              Soccer has been my go to when I am not in a good mood. It helps me relieve stress and calms me down when I am mad. I really love the game and when I watch games on tv the fans are so into the game. The fans and the players show passion during the game and without passion soccer would be nothing.
